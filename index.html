							<h2 class="major">Introduction</h2>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/i1.gif" alt="" /></span>
							<p>Ever thought about what can be done with the waste we throw or the plants we cut down?</p>
							<p>What if we could use this waste to make electricity? Or what if someone
								could plant 500 seeds in an hour?</p>
								<p>Seems impossible right? But Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep
								Learning can make it possible.</p>
								<p>Just think about it- A robot which could make electricity out of waste and
								could plant 500 seeds in an hour! In total it can plant about 36 lakh seeds in a year by working for 20 hours a day!</p>
								<p>We call this robot <strong>STWESS</strong>, <strong>S</strong>canning <strong>T</strong>hermographic <strong>W</strong>aste to <strong>E</strong>lectricity and <strong>S</strong>eed <strong>S</strong>ower.</p>
								<p><ol><li>The Robot has three utilities- It can scan the temperatures of many people at the same time, It can plant seeds on
								it’s own with soil identification, It can sense waste, segregate it into
								organic and synthetic waste and convert that to electricity.</li></ol></p>
								<p style="margin-left: 20px;">2. Large Scale Thermal Scanning- With an
								external drone having a thermal sensor and range sensor, the mini drone can
								move autonomously and scan the temperature of many people at the same from high
								up the air for accuracy.</p>
								<p style="margin-left: 20px;"></p>
								<p style="margin-left: 20px;">Q. Why does the drone scan it from above the air?</p>
								<p style="margin-left: 20px;">Ans. If two people are overlapping each other while standing, the scanner cannot detect accurate temperatures, but from high up, the heads of the people are exposed and cannot be overlapped.</p>
								<p style="margin-left: 20px;"></p>
								<p style="margin-left: 20px;">3. Autonomous Seed Planting- using ML and DL
								through Tensor Flow, STWESS can identify places with soil where if plants are
								planted no one would have problems. </p>
								<p style="margin-left: 20px;">4. Waste Segregation and Electricity
								conversion- By using TensorFlow along with AI and DL the robot can segregate
								waste and burn it inside itself to produce smoke which would then power the
								turbine to form electricity.</p>
								<p style="margin-left: 20px;">5. The robot is powered by 15, 100 kWh
								sodium-ion batteries which make it cost-efficient over lithium-ion batteries
								and 15 smaller batteries also decrease the charging time. Therefore, the robot
								has a battery life of 20 hoyrs and can charge in less than 3 hours.</p>

							<h3>Large Scale Thermal Scanning</h3><ul>
								<li>STWESS has a mini drone built-in which can be ejected. It has a Thermal Camera, a normal 720p camera along with a LiDAR Sensor(range sensor) for autonomous movement.
								</li><li>For it flying up in the air, the scan would be accurate, if it was not in the air then people could overlap each other and that could lead to wrong temperatures.
								</li><li>The drone uses a simple AI algorithm which after detecting more than 98.6°F in any person clicks his/her photograph and sends it to the authorities.
								</li><li>This would save a lot of time and a lot of lives.</li></ul><h3>Autonomous Seed Planting</h3><ul>
								<li>This section of the robot would use Raspberry 4 Model B- 8GB RAM, a Raspberry Pi 720p Camera Module, and a seed ejector.
								</li><li>The working is simple- It can detect soil and even decide whether someone would have problems with a plant/tree there. After soil detection and problem checking the robot plants seeds using the ejector.</li><li>Tensor Flow would be used for the detection which would be coded in C# making the processing fast, powerful, and accurate.</li></ul><h3>Waste Segregation and Electricity conversion</h3><ul><li>This part of the robot can detect waste and separate it into organic and synthetic. Then STWESS burns it inside itself
								in a closed space, oxygen tanks are there in the robot which helps in the
								burning process.</li><li>After burning both the wastes the smoke
								is used to power a turbine inside the robot which generates electricity. The
								ash left after burning the organic waste is used as manure for planting seeds
								and can also be distributed between poor farmers.</li><li>The smoke left after powering the turbine
								can be used in processes such as metal smelting.</li><li>STWESS has one chamber just dedicated for
								cooling of the robot, the parts of the robot are made with high-quality
								materials that don’t corrode in this process.</li><li>For safety purposes, the robot can cut-off
								if the temperature goes above 120°C.</li></ul></p>

												<span class="image main"><img src="images/o2.gif" alt="" /></span>
												<h3>Benefits & Adavantages</h3>
												<p><ul><li>Using the robot in public places for thermal scanning would reduce human effort and
													would also save. A human can take a lot more time, whereas a robot is quite
													efficient. It would also do scanning accurately and precisely; errors may occur
													when humans are appointed to do the same task. Infrared Thermometers are found to be inaccurate but a high-quality thermal camera is quite accurate.</li><li>Converting
													waste to electricity would not only make electricity and make the environment free of the waste but also reduce global warming.</li><li>Along with tackling these all
													problems it would also reduce water pollution as synthetic waste(mostly
													plastic) is also disposed off in oceans and river bodies.</li><li>Planting 500
													seeds in an hour would also bring a huge change in the world by reducing Green
													House Effect which would bring down Earth’s temperature.</li><li>Many
													smaller sodium-ion batteries make the robot power, cost, and charge efficient.</li></ul></p>
													<h3>Future Scope</h3>
													<p>If three such robots are there in one constituency then-</p><p style="margin-left: 20px;">1.  The normal change in temperature over a
														year in India is about 0.84°C,
														but with this robot, it can be brought down to 0.10.(approx)</p><p style="margin-left: 20px;">2.  The
														average trees in a state in India is about 22.4 lakhs, but when this robot is
														used, this number can be doubled in about a year.</p><p style="margin-left: 20px;">3.  In
														this coronavirus pandemic the cases India are increasing at a tremendous rate, and
														people confuse coronavirus fever with common cold or weather change and don’t
														get their test done. This can be dangerous but the mini drone in our robot can
														tackle this problem by scanning many people at one time and if fever is found
														it sends the picture of the person to the authorities.<span id="selection-marker-2" class="redactor-selection-marker"></span></p>

								<h2 class="major">Science Behind The Working</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/s1.gif" alt="" /></span>
								<h3>Large Scale Thermal Scanning</h3>
								<p style="margin-left: 20px;">1.  <strong>Mini Drone-</strong>  It is generally small enough to fit in your hand. They are made to retain the camera quality and features usually associated with larger drones. With all this, our drone also has a Thermal Camera for scanning, a LiDAR scanner for autonomous movement, a powerful AI and DL algorithm & a 720p Camera. There are four mini motors with blades that propel the drone in the air, using the LiDAR scanner the drone recognizes the position of each object in real-time which helps it in the movement. With a high-quality Thermal Camera, the drone can detect the accurate temperature of each person and if it is more than 98.6°F, it clicks the picture of the person using the 720p camera and sends it to the authorities.</p>
								<p style="margin-left: 20px;">2. <strong>Thermal Camera-</strong>  It is a device that creates an image using infrared radiation. Instead of the 400–700 nm range of the normal camera, infrared cameras are sensitive to wavelengths from about 1,000 nm to about 14,000 nm. And therefore can give distinct colors for different temperatures, hot colors for high temperatures(orange, red, yellow) & cool colors for cooler temperatures(blue, green).</p>
								<p style="margin-left: 20px;">3.  <strong>LiDAR Scanner-</strong> It stands for Light Detection and Ranging and uses a method for measuring distances (ranging) by illuminating the target with laser light and measuring the reflection with a sensor. Differences in laser return times and wavelengths can then be used to make a digital 3D representation of the target.</p>
								<p style="margin-left: 20px;">4.  <strong>Algorithm-</strong> When fever is detected, it calls the 720p camera to click the picture and then it sends it to the authorities.</p>
								<p style="margin-left: 20px;">5.  <strong>720p Camera-</strong> A camera is an optical instrument used to record images. At their most basic, cameras are sealed boxes with a small hole that allow light in to capture an image on a light-sensitive surface.</p>
								<h3>Autonomous Seed Planting</h3> 
								<p style="margin-left: 20px;">1.  <strong>Soil Detection- </strong>Using AI & DL the robot can find soil in images, the robot first clicks images every second and
									then tries to find appropriate soil, after detection the robot uses ML via
									TensorFlow and DL to decide whether a plant can be sown in the area and if
									someone could have problems for example- the robot won’t sow plants in a
									parking area with soil. The robot can also distinguish between soil i.e. sandy,
									loamy et Cetra and find the appropriate soil for the plant. After all the
									conditions are met, the robot calls the seed ejector to plant seeds. Then puts
									some manure produced from the organic waste chamber.</p><p style="margin-left: 20px;">2.  <strong>Seed ejector-</strong> The seed ejector uses an open and close mechanism that sows seeds when called just like a normal
									seed-drill.</p><p style="margin-left: 20px;">3.  <strong>Manure Addition-</strong> The Seed Ejector chamber
									is connected to the organic waste chamber. After burning the organic waste we
									are left with ash which is used as manure.</p><p style="margin-left: 20px;">4.  After the process the frame<span id="selection-marker-1" class="redactor-selection-marker">s shot by the
									camera are deleted which makes the robot efficient.</span></p>
								<h3>Waste Segregation and Electricity conversion</h3>
								<p style="margin-left: 20px;">1.  <strong>Waste Segregation-</strong> The robot uses AI and DL to segregate waste to organic and synthetic and ML to learn more. Just like
									the Seed ejector this part also analyses each frame and discards it after the
									process. After detection organic waste is collected in the Organic waste
									Chamber and The Synthetic Waste is collected in the Synthetic Waste Chamber.</p><p style="margin-left: 20px;">2.  <strong>Burning Waste-</strong> After collection, both the
									wastes are burnt in the burning chamber in a closed environment with continuous
									supply of oxygen from the oxygen tanks inside the robot.</p><p style="margin-left: 20px;">3.  <strong>Turbine Rotator-</strong> The smoke from both the
									chambers is used to propel the turbine in the turbine chamber which produces
									electricity. All the parts of this process are made of high-quality materials
									and are resistant to the extreme heat and smoke of the process.</p><p style="margin-left: 20px;">4.  The smoke left is then compressed in tiny
									tanks inside the robot which then can be used in processes such as smelting.<span id="selection-marker-1" class="redactor-selection-marker"></span></p>
